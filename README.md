# graph_placement_simulated_annealing.py

This code performs simulated annealing-based optimization to find a better placement of nodes in a graph that minimizes the total interconnect length. The nodes in the graph represent components or elements that need to be placed close to each other based on their connections.

# graph_longest_interconnect.py

 This script performs an iterative placement algorithm to find a placement order for the nodes that minimizes the longest interconnect length. The longest interconnect length is the maximum distance between connected nodes in the placement order.

 # graph_track_counting.py

 This code calculates the minimum number of tracks required to connect nodes in a graph based on their connections. It uses a sorting-based approach to determine the placement order and dynamic programming to calculate the track count. This type of analysis is important in designing efficient layouts for various applications such as integrated circuits and communication networks.
